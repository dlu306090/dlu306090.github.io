          <p><sup>29</sup>But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” <sup>30</sup>Jesus replied, “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead. <sup>31</sup>Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side. <sup>32</sup>So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. <sup>33</sup> But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion. <sup>34</sup>He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him. <sup>35</sup>And the next day he took out two denarii[a] and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, ‘Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.’ <sup>36</sup>Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?” <sup>37</sup>He said, “The one who showed him mercy.” And Jesus said to him, “You go, and do likewise.”</p>

                  Yes! Because according to the bible, we should love others as we love ourselves. Because if we have a Christ-like mindset, and Christ died so that we should live, how much more ought we to help people when it costs us only risk of harm. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  For instance, here's what 1 John 3:14-19 says: 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p><sup>14</sup>We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death. <sup>15</sup>Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
                  <sup>16</sup>By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and <b>we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.</b> <sup>17</sup>But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him? <sup>18</sup>Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.
                  <sup>19</sup>By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him.</p>
                  Or see <a href="#loveJesus">here</a> for a passage that says we should love other people as we love Jesus!

          <h4>Matthew 25:31-46</h4>
          <p><sup>31</sup>“When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. <sup>32</sup>Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. <sup>33</sup>And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. <sup>34</sup>Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. <sup>35</sup>For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, <sup>36</sup>I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ <sup>37</sup>Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? <sup>38</sup>And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? <sup>39</sup>And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ <sup>40</sup>And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’
          <sup>41</sup>“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. <sup>42</sup>For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, <sup>43</sup>I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’ <sup>44</sup>Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’ <a name="loveJesus"></a><sup>45</sup><b>Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’</b> <sup>46</sup>And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”

                  Like previous passage, we ought to provide physical nourishment when possible, but also go beyond that to think about a person’s emotional and spiritual nourishment – we look at people as whole people, who need more than just food! And we can help people in ways other than giving them food, if we aren’t rich. We ought to help not just people who are clearly in poverty, like the homeless, but also brothers and sisters who are sick, going through difficult life circumstances, etc.

Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. <sup>22</sup>The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side.[a] The rich man also died and was buried, <sup>23</sup>and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side. <sup>24</sup>And he called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.’ <sup>25</sup>But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. <sup>26</sup>And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.’ <sup>27</sup>And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's house— <sup>28</sup>for I have five brothers—so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.’ <sup>29</sup>But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.’ <sup>30</sup>And he said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’ <sup>31</sup>He said to him, ‘If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.’”

                  The rich man has many opportunities to help the poor man. There are fewer risks involved, because there aren’t any bandits around. Plus, helping the poor man would help his reputation within the community, as anyone could see if the poor man was being fed. Unlike the previous passage, where no one knew about the priest and Levite’s negligence, the rich man’s negligence of the poor man is readily apparent. Plus, it’s much easier to give a man food than to dig him out of a hole and find bandages, etc.

                  Because when we as individuals show mercy to the needy, often certain needy people are overlooked. Bringing the problem of neediness into an administrative setting helps us to look at the bigger picture and ensure that we don’t show partiality to only those needy that we want to serve or those who are closest to us.
